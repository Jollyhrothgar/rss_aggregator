# Project Statement

News aggregators like Google News, Apple News, Flipboard, etc, provide a
personalized news experience. But what about the echo-chamber effect where one
is exposed to unseen media bias, or the same articles again and again?

Personalization of a news feed can be tricky, because it requires knowledge of
a latent space of possible variables in langauge space.
